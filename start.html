    <p class="para">It has come to our attention that a group of scientists made a substance known as Anti-Gerasone. Anti-Gerasone should not be approved in anyway, especially by the pharmaceutical firm of Vlad and DeLeon.
        If this substance gets into the hands of the public, there will be severe consequences, the consequences are dependant on its historical aftermath. We are currently trying to convince the government to terminate the production of Anti-Gerasone.

    <p class="para">Foremost, the population on earth will be excessively high and we will have to resort to either mass execution. There will be room for our population to live. The housing will become an impossiblity as homes can only hold so many people. The proximity of the living quarters will lead to social unrest and the destruction of the family unit. The ability to have personal space will be impossible. There would be the possiblity of using another planet as a home however even that cannot last forever, if at all.

    <p class="para">Overpopulation will deplete the world's natural resources. No longer will we be able to go into a grocery store and choose amongst the products of what we want to eat. There will be no choices. The population will have to consume products produced from meterials that contain cheap and available substances. Natural resources such as hydro electricity, natural gas, even water will be insufficent to service the overpopulation. Also, money will be reserved for the elder Anti-Gerasone consumers leaving the younger generation penniless.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="para">The elimination of Anti-Gerasone is imperative to our future. The many sources cited are proof that this product will eventually be end of life as we have known it and result in a calamity.</p>
