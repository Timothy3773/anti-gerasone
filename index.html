    <p class="para">It has come to our attention that a group of scientists made a substance known as Anti-Gerasone. Anti-Gerasone should not be approved in anyway, especially by the pharmaceutical firm of Vlad and DeLeon.
        If this substance gets into the hands of the public, there will be severe consequences, the consequences are depedant on its historical aftermath. We are currently trying to convince the government to terminate the production of Anti-Gerasone.
